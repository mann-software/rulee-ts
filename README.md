> UI-centered rule engine to manage your business rules.

**Note:** rulee-ts is still *experimental* as long as the version is < 1.0.0. With the beginning of version 1.0.0 the author will use rulee-ts for his own projects in production and semantic versioning will be applied from then on.

Feature-rich to make things easy:
- fully typed rule definitions
- supports synchronous and asynchronous processing of rules
- abstract properties can be fields, groups, list ... and are composable
- define rules via builders
- dependency graph for efficient processing and visualization
- complex ui behavior, e.g. backpressure handling included
- and more ...

## Install

```
$ npm install rulee-ts
```

## Getting started

Documentation still to be done. For now, see tests in folder: `src/__tests__`
